# The Coder's Computer

## Why it's important for Software Developers to be thoughtful about what Text Editors they use 

- **Text Editors help personalize your workspace, and make coding easier**

Some Text Editors will have their unique custumizations and features, but it's important to have the following:
1. code completion 
  - helps assist you to find mistakes and avoid typos
  - saves time
2. themes
  - help you read your code  
  - reduce eye strain
3. syntax highlighting
  - colorizes certain text to make it more noticeable
  - easy to read and distinguish among different types of code
 
 

## How to use your Terminal to navigate among your folders

- **I want to explain the most relevant and basic navigation codes:**
1. cd
  - stands for "change directory"
  - use this command followed by the name of a folder to take you into that folder
 
`cd Documents`

  - you do not need to move one single folder at a time, if you know what folder you want to move into, you will just navigate into it
 
 `cd [name of folder]`
 
  - if you need to go backwards between directories, use 

`cd ..`

2. ls
  - short for "list" 
  - if you need to know the folders you have available try the line "ls" by itself.
 
`ls`

  - to see a list of folders within a folder, ex:`ls [interior folder name]`, you would have to be within the immediate folder that contains the desired folder you want to view the list of.

3. pwd
  - stands for "print working directory"
  - if you need to know where you currently are within your folders, use this line by itself and it will return where you are

`pwd`
