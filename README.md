Here's what I've learned
Each line of code in Markdown represents a feature of a webpage that you can build from scratch however you want to build it.
You can use a Template from [GitHub](https://github.com/) to help you begin the webdesign process, but you're limited by your own creativity.
Markdown - is how you alter or change certain types of text, through **bolding** or *italics* or -bulleted lists, etc.
