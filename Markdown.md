# MARKDOWN

`Here's what I've learned`

### Each line of code in Markdown represents a feature of a webpage that you can build from scratch however you want to build it.

> Markdown - is how you alter or change certain types of text, with symbols by **bolding** or *italics* or -bulleted lists, etc. 

###### A (# hashtag) will change the heading size of a line of text, with one hashtag representing the largest font size and six representing the smallest  

**I do also want to be intentional to talk about how to make pages on GitHub**
- ex. I want to make a Page for Contact Info
1. On your repository `main page` you can go to the "Add file" dropdown option
2. Choose "Create new file"
3. Name your file/page "contact-info.md"
4. From there, you can build the page using Markdown and then you can link it by typing `[name of the webpage](hyperlink)`
